# Google Triggers Reference

> **Notice of usage:** Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) are third party services and we provide this integration as is.
We support a set of custom events and Data Layer variables for use with GTM and GA4, however we have no control over what happens to them and how they are used. The basic setup examples we provide have been tested and verified to work with the Mews Booking Engine, however if you need a more complex setup then we cannot provide the support to do so and we recommend to ask a specialist to set it up and test it for you.

This reference provides details of **custom events** and **Data Layer variables** generated within the Booking Engine, which can be used to trigger analytics tags to fire, i.e. to send data to Google Analytics.
You will need to reference these events and variables when setting up tag _triggers_ in Google Tag Manager.

## Data Layer variables

All event data is passed to Google Tag Manager through a _Data Layer_.

> ### What is a Data Layer?
> A Data Layer is a Javascript object in a website or app that collects analytics data in a standardized way. It acts as a layer between the site and the tag management system.
> The layer stores values, such as page name and URL, that are populated automatically when a visitor uses the site.
> The data is transferred into tag management variables and can be used to activate triggers in your tag configurations.
> [Google Help â€” The data layer](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6164391?hl=en)

To use data from the Data Layer in your tags, in the GTM configuration set up a _Variable_ with a suitable name as a Data Layer Variable (DLV), like this:

![variable](../.gitbook/assets/variable.png)

The [Custom events](#custom-events) reference below describes which Data Layer Variables are relevant to which custom events.

> **Prices:** Note all prices currently presented via the Data Layer are gross prices, i.e. including taxes and fees.

### Data Layer Variables in events

Each event is fired with a standard set of data:

| Data Layer Variable Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| eventName | Name of the event, in readable form without prefix, e.g. `Voucher Added`. |
| trackingConsents | [Tracking consents](#tracking-consents) applied at the time the event was created. |

If a user selects a hotel or property in the Booking Engine, information about it is also added to the event. In _Singlehotel_ mode, the property is always selected.

| Data Layer Variable Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| hotelName | Name of the hotel or property |
| hotelId | Unique identifier of the hotel or property |
| enterpriseName | Array with name of the enterprise (hotel / property) in each supported language |

Pageload events with the 'ga4_' prefix also have the following attributes available in the Data Layer:

| Data Layer Variable Name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| page_location | URL style location, to be used for tracking URL |
| page_title | Human readable name of page or screen|

Some events expose additional DLVs. These are described separately for each event.

### Tracking consents
