# Integrations

The Booking Engine Widget supports direct integration with [Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/) and [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/).
The integration with Google Tag Manager is intended only to serve data to Google Analytics.

> ### ðŸš¨ Disclaimer regarding Google Analytics data accuracy
> 
> We understand that some property owners have expressed concerns about discrepancies between the data they see in Google Analytics (GA) and the actual reality. Itâ€™s essential to be aware of the following factors:
> 
> **Ad Blockers impact**
> - Approximately 33% of internet users utilize ad blockers, which can block Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager (GTM) scripts. See for example this article for a reference: <a href="https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users" target="_blank">https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users</a>.
> - Consequently, the data received from these services may not be 100% accurate.
> - Metrics such as revenue and the number of bookings may appear lower than the actual figures, due to ad-blocking behavior.
> 
> **Consent and tracking**
> - If a guest declines cookies or tracking, their interactions wonâ€™t be tracked in Google Analytics.
> 
> Please remember to address these considerations when interpreting GA data and making business decisions.
