# Reference

## Options reference

> **Note:** Direct configuration of Distributor through the options has been deprecated and it will be disabled in future.
> Prefer to use Distributor Configuration in Commander. The only supported now are`configurationIds`and`openElements`.

| Name | Type | Default value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| configurationIds \(required\) | array of`string` | `''` | Unique identifier of the used Distributor configurations.  You can get unique identifier of a configuration from it’s details page in Commander. The unique identifier is shown there as Identifier. |
| openElements | `string` | `''` | A list of comma-separated CSS selectors of elements, which will automatically get attached click event listeners for opening Distributor. The string is given as an argument to the`document.querySelectorAll`function, you get more info about its resemblance[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll)for example.  The click event is being delegated, meaning that each element is being looked up on a website dynamically after the click happens. This way you can pass a selector to the elements that don’t exist yet during the initialization. |

## API reference

API calls are defined on the Distributor instance, which is created with the initialization call. This instance is returned to you as an argument of a callback function that you can pass as the second parameter to the initialization call. The following simple example shows how to use the calls to set up start and end dates, and then open the Distributor:

```javascript
<!-- Example of use of an instance to call the API -->
<script>
Mews.Distributor({
    configurationIds: ['aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee'],
}, function(distributor) {
   $('.booking-button').click(function() {
     var start = new Date();
     var end = new Date();
     end.setDate(start.getDate() + 2);

     distributor.setStartDate(start);
     distributor.setEndDate(end);
     distributor.open();
   });
});
</script>
```

Beware that API is slightly different in the\_Single\_and the\_Chain\_modes. The list of all API calls follows:

### Common API calls

#### open\(\)

Opens Distributor in its overlay.

#### close\(\)

#### setCurrencyCode\(currencyCode\)

* `currencyCode` Type: `string` - The currencyCode to be set, in [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format, i.e`EUR`

* Example - good (18 January 2019):

```javascript

```javascript
distributor.setStartDate("2019-01-18")
```

#### setEndDate\(date\)

* `date` Type: `Date` - The end date to set

Sets end date for a new availability query, currently loaded availability list is not affected. If a `date` is not a valid Date object - nothing happens.

* Example - good (18 December 2019):

```javascript
distributor.setEndDate(new Date(2019, 11, 18))
```

distributor.setEndDate("2019-12-18")
```

        api.open();
    },
    { dataBaseUrl: 'https://api.mews-demo.com' }
);
```

#### string dataBaseUrl

Allows you to define custom URL which is used for distributor API calls and static assets. In the example above, the Distributor will be run against our Demo environment.
