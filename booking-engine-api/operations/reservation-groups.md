| Property | Type | Contract | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Client` | string | required | Client application name, as described in [Authentication](../guidelines/authentication.md). |
| `ConfigurationId` | string | required | Unique identifier of the Booking Engine configuration used. |
| `HotelId` | string | required | Unique identifier of the hotel. |
| `Customer` | [Customer](#customer) | required | Information about the customer or guest. |
| `Booker` | [Customer](#customer) | optional | Information about the person making the booking. |
| `Reservations` | array of [Reservation data](#reservation-data) | required | Reservation parameters, such as dates and quantities of persons. |
| `CreditCardData` | [Credit card data](#credit-card-data) | optional | Credit card data, required if hotel has payment gateway. |
| `AvailabilityBlockId` | string | optional | Unique identifier of availability block if present. Provide always when you have it.  |

#### Customer

| Property | Type | Contract | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Email` | string | required | Email of the customer. |
| `FirstName` | string | required | First name of the customer. |
| `LastName` | string | required | Last name of the customer. |
| `Telephone` | string | optional | Telephone number of the customer. |
| `NationalityCode` | string | optional | ISO 3166-1 Aplha-2 code of the customerâ€™s nation country, e.g.`US`. |
| `SendMarketingEmails` | boolean | optional | Subscribe to marketing emails. When `Booker` is present, this should be `false` or `null` because the customer is not subscribing, the booker is. See [Send marketing emails](#send-marketing-emails). |

#### Send marketing emails

The boolean flag `SendMarketingEmails` indicates if the user has opted in to receive marketing communication or not.
The API accepts the following values:

* `true` - subscription is created
* `false` - subscription is disabled
* `null` - subscription remains untouched

When `Booker` is present in the request, we assume that the booker is booking on behalf of the customer, but their opt-in to marketing communication is for them as user and not for the customer.
Therefore, the `SendMarketingEmails` property for the booker should be set according to the user's choice, while the `SendMarketingEmails` property for the customer should be set to `false` or `null`.
